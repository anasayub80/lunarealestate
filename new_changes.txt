Admin
Notification for new incoming property
On the property i just uploaded it says I bought it so I need the data not to be operated to avoid confusion
when asked client to explain it got this msg.
(It wants to verify that your not a robot. By having you make a payment by making a deposit not charging more than 200 then it will ask for a upgrade)
Dates on when the property was submitted
For master addmin to add users so I can send secondary admins tasks to give them orders thru the app and assign houses to the secondary admins.

For master admin can we suspend accounts so we have control and security?
A live view or history on who was on date and time?
User
On the information clicked i left things unfilled and it allowed me to go the the next  portion make it required to fill in the blank.

Admin
Analytics to see how many users download and are live using the app
---------------------------------
On the location what is the purposes of that if admin can't verify the location of property they are selling.
Location to be used for them to mark the exact location of the property so admins can see property location on map.
---------------------
Add calendar to schedule in app appointments. (ye bhi explain kren kis tarah ki appointment hogi? on site ya zoom pr kia free hogi ya paid)

I didnt know the access to admin but It's still very underwhelming.
I need a master log in to see who is on app strong security. Ability to suspend users.
Notification.
It need alot still. It looks better. But still very underperformed.
-------------------------
Notification for seller. To let them know we received there information and we'll schedule a meeting or call.

For the app I need to be able to kick out. Assign tasks to users a master admin and secondary admins
