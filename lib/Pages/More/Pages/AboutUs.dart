[Read more] “Annual interest,” “Annualized Return” or “Target Returns” represents a projected annual target rate of interest or annualized target return, and no returns or interest is obtained by fund investors. “Term” represents the estimated term of the investment; the term of the fund is generally at the discretion of the fund’s manager, and may exceed the estimated term by a significant amount of time. Unless otherwise specified on the fund’s offering page, target interest or returns are based on an analysis performed by Luna Enterprises of the potential inflows and outflows related to the transactions in which the strategy or fund has engaged and/or is anticipated to engage in over the estimated term of the fund. There is no guarantee that targeted interest or returns will be realized or achieved or that an investment will be successful. Actual performance may deviate from these expectations materially, including due to market or economic factors, portfolio management decisions, modeling errors, or other reasons. Reflects the annualized distribution rate that is calculated by taking the most recent quarterly distribution approved by the Fund’s Board of Directors and dividing it by the prior quarter-end NAV and analyzing it. The Fund’s distribution may exceed its earnings. Therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution may be a return of the money you originally invested and represent a return of capital to you for tax purposes. Represents the sum of the interest accrued during the statement period plus the interest paid during the statement period. The internal rate of return (“IRR”) represents an average net realized IRR concerning all matured investments, excluding our Short Term Notes program, weighted by the investment size of each investment, made by private investment vehicles managed by Luna Enterprises Management, LLC from July 1, 2015, through and including July 18th, 2022, after deduction of management fees and all other expenses charged to investments.
